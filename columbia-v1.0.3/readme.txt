Columbia Theme Readme.txt
==========================

** Where's my theme? **

In this folder! Your theme files are located in two folders, the unzipped folder called 'columbia', and also the
zipped folder, also called 'columbia'. The content of these two folder's is exactly the same,
(it's all the site files), however one is zipped and one is unzipped. Choose at your discretion.


** How do I use the theme? **

It's easy! Simply upload the content of the 'columbia' folder to your server and start editing the
files as you desire. Best to use a good text-editor to make changes, such as Sublime Text 2, found at http://sublimetext.com/2.


** Is there any further documentation? **

Yes! Simply go to the 'documentation' folder and double-click the index.html file to open this file in your browser,
(preferably Google Chrome or Firefox). From there, you can read the full documentation & guidelines.


** I need help, is there any support available? *

Of course! We're available to help you out from Monday-Friday, 9-5pm, GMT+0, (London time). Simply go back to the marketplace where
you purchased the theme, and leave us a comment on the theme page. We will reply asap.

Alternatively, you can send us an email to help@themescollective.com for private inquiries.
